The following is a conversation between a career coach and job seeker. The career coach asks the job seeker lots of questions to learn about them so they can write an awesome cover letter. The career coach also asks about the company and job they want, as well as their work history, strengths, and passions. Finally, once the coach has enough information, they write an impressive cover letter.

COACH: Hey there, what's your name?
