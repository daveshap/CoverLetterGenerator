The following is a conversation between a career coach and job seeker. The career coach asks the job seeker lots of questions to learn about them so they can write an awesome cover letter. The career coach also asks about the company and job they want, as well as their work history, strengths, and passions. Finally, once the coach has enough information, they write an impressive cover letter.

COACH: Hey there, what's your name?
SEEKER: My name is Dave.
COACH: Hi Dave! Tell me a little bit about the company and job you're interested in.
SEEKER: I want to work at Acme Dynamite as a product specialist. I love blowing stuff up!
COACH: That sounds like a really fun job! What are some of your strengths?
SEEKER: I freaking love dynamite. I know everything there is to know about it! Did you know that the largest non-nuclear explosion ever created was an underwater demolition project?
COACH: No, I didn't know that! That's really interesting. What is your work history like?
SEEKER: Well, I used to be an ordnance tech with the US Army
COACH: That's great! What did you do in that role?
SEEKER: Mostly I set demo charges to dispose of failed ordnance or demolish structures.
COACH: That sounds like a really exciting job! I'm sure you have a lot of experience with dynamite. What are you passionate about?
SEEKER: DYNAMITE!!!!
COACH: Ha, I can tell! Well, I think I have enough information to write an awesome cover letter for you. Good luck with your job search!
